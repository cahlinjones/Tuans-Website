                    <p class="testimonial-text">Fantastic salon with the most skilled stylists around. I have been seeing Lien since around 2004 and even though I live in Los Angeles now, will always make an appointment with her when I am visiting family here. I thought I had lost her when I called their previous salon (Studio H2O) to make an appointment, but some quick googling put me in touch with the new location at Hairlab+.</p>

I only get my haircut about every three months, and it still looks great the entire time. Worth every penny!</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">I love coming to Elena. They just moved over here but the space is so gorgeous. The people who work here have an amazing level of work ethic and they are so communicative with each other. When they're in a pinch they help each other out. I came for a trim on my asymmetrical bob. It's a gorgeous blonde color. Elena helped me understand how it would turn out as well as making sure I was really happy with it at the end. I have no doubts I'll be coming here for years to come.</p>
